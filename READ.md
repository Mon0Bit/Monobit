> 100 Games in 100 Days. Black and White. No Compromises.

A minimalist retro gaming collection built with pure web technologies. Each game stripped to its core mechanics, presented in a brutalist monochrome aesthetic.

## 🎮 THE PHILOSOPHY

In a world of endless colors, animations, and effects, we chose constraints.

**Black and White. Pixel Art. Simple Mechanics.**

These limitations aren't weaknesses—they're our strength. When you remove the visual noise, what remains is pure gameplay. Strategy. Skill. Focus.

This is how games were meant to be experienced.

## 🎯 THE CHALLENGE

**100 games in 100 days.** One game released every single day.

- Puzzle challenges
- Reflex tests
- Strategy battles
- Memory games
- Word puzzles
- Logic grids
- Arcade classics reimagined

Each game stripped to its core mechanics. Black and white. No compromises.
